<p> <b> Introduction</b>: COVID-19 infected millions of people and became the main mortality worldwide. The COVID-19 also affected other health problems; nutritional problems. This study was aimed to find the factors that affected the nutritional status and socio-economic during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Neighborhood of DKI Jakarta. </p>
Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and total sampling method from all families in the 9th Neighborhood, Cawang Sub-District, DKI Jakarta who had children. A total of 72 families were involved in this study, and the informants of this study were mothers of children under five. This study utilized a modified questionnaire from the Indonesian National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) and the Indonesian Nutritional Status Study (SSGI). This study utilized bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. 
Results: From all 72 families with children, it was found that a total of eight children were wasting. The Job-Loss (PHK) has an OR of 37.8 (p = 0.001), while the poverty status is 14.24 (p = 0.004). The multivariate variables included covariates such as parental occupation, parental education, and antenatal care (ANC). Job-Loss and Below Poverty Line were main factors in increasing the risk of malnutrition cases with covariates. 
Conclusion: The socio-economic status of a family during the pandemic, increased the risk of wasted children. Improvements in policy interventions and socio-economic aids are necessary to improve the nutritional status of children under five in the lower-middle class during the COVID-19 pandemic.
